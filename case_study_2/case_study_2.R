## Analyze

# first we will view the summary of all data sets

## Daily Activity

summary(daily_activity)

## Daily activity summary takeaways

# This summary shows the average user is taking 7638 steps a day, missing the recommended 10,000 steps
# for health by the CDC. On average, users are getting 21.16 minutes of very active or vigorous
# activity a day, this equates to 148.12 minutes a week. The CDC recommends 75 minutes of vigorous
# activity a week, so the typical Fitbit user is doing well in this area and achieving additional
# health benefits. In contrast, participants are averaging 991.2 minutes, or 16.52 hours of sedentary
# time a day! This is a significant amount of time and can lead to other health issues because the
# body functions best upright. Scientists have determined that 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous
# activity a day will balance out the effects of sitting up to 10 hours a day. Furthermore, this
# summary shows the average user is burning 2304 calories a day. Studies show the average person in
# the population burns 1800 calories a day, but burning 3500 is needed to lose a pound of weight. The
# Fitbit users in this case are burning more than the norm, and are on track to lose a few pounds a
# week if they so choose to.

## Hourly Calories

summary(hourly_calories)

## Hourly calories summary takeaways

# From the summary we can see that on a average scale a person is burning up to 97.39 calories per hour 
# Which is 97.39*24 = 2337.36 if we take 24 hours on scale. And the maximum value is 948 , we know that 
# burning 3500 calories is needed to lose a pound , i think those who are burning at this rate are in
# hurry to lose all their extra weights :)

## Hourly intensity

summary(hourly_intensities_summary_data)


## Hourly intensity summary takeaways

# From our summary we can see that a person on average scale is in intense activity of 12.04 minutes per hour,
# which is 12.04*24 = 288.96 minutes equivalent to  288.96/60 = 4.816 or around 5 hours of intense activity  each day
# And the highest value intensity of a single is 904.0 which is almost 904/60 = 15.06 hour on Sunday. 


## Sleep Day

summary(sleep_day)

## Sleep Day summary takeaways

# The summary of the sleep data frame displays the average user sleeps once per day for 419.5 minutes, or roughly 7 hours.
# This falls within the CDCâ€™s recommendations for adults in order to get the proper amount of rest. The average
# participant is spending 458.6 minutes in bed, or 7.64 hours. This means the typical user is spending 38.6 minutes awake
# in bed. According to Health Central, people should not spend more than 1 hour in bed awake. This is to prevent a mental
# link being formed between being awake and being in bed, which can lead to insomnia.

## Weight Log

summary(weight_log)

## Weight log summary takeaways

# Data frame has a low number of participants, and the average BMI is 25.19. This is considered as overweight BMI.
# However, BMI can be a screening tool and does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an person.

# Activity overview

min_in_day = 60*24

Sedentary = (mean(daily_activity$SedentaryMinutes)/ min_in_day ) * 100
VeryActive = (mean(daily_activity$VeryActiveMinutes)/ min_in_day) * 100
LightActive = (mean(daily_activity$LightlyActiveMinutes)/ min_in_day) * 100
FairlyActive = (mean(daily_activity$FairlyActiveMinutes)/ min_in_day) * 100

activity_df = data.frame(Status = c('Sedentary', 'VeryActive', 'LightActive', 'FairlyActive'),
                         Percentage = c(Sedentary, VeryActive, LightActive, FairlyActive))

  
ggplot(activity_df) + geom_col(mapping=aes(x=Status, y=Percentage, fill=Status))

# From the visualization we can see that majority of users almost ( 69% ) percentage are spending
# time in sedentary state . And only 13% of them are Lightly Active.

## Active weekday frequency

daily_activity$day_of_week <- factor(daily_activity$day_of_week, levels=c('Saturday','Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday'))


ggplot(daily_activity) + geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=day_of_week, fill=day_of_week))

# From the above visualization we can see that users are most active on "Tuesday" , "Wednesday" 
# "Thursday" and least active on "Sunday", "Monday".


## Steps weekday frequency

step_freq = daily_activity %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(avg_steps = mean(TotalSteps))

ggplot(step_freq) + geom_col(mapping=aes(x=day_of_week, y=avg_steps, fill=day_of_week))

# From the above summary we can see that on average scale users didn't achieved recommended 10000
# steps in any day of the week. But the highest average steps are from Saturday and Tuesday. And the 
# Lowest is from Sunday , we can conclude that users are being lazy at weekends. 


## Steps vs Calories

ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(col='blue', method=lm, se=FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~day_of_week)

# This visualization is too much faded , lets try to separate these visualizations by week day.
 
# Saturday

ggplot(filter(daily_activity, day_of_week=='Saturday'), aes(TotalSteps, Calories)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)

# Sunday
ggplot(filter(daily_activity, day_of_week=='Sunday'), aes(TotalSteps, Calories)) +

## Steps vs Calories Visualization takeaways

# From above all scatter plots , we can see that their is a positive relationship between
# Steps and Calories burned. The more you walk , more you will burn Calories.


## Sleep vs Calories 

# First we need to merge daily_activity with sleep data in order to get Calories data.
cal_daily = select(daily_activity, Id, ActivityDate, Calories, day_of_week)
sleep_day =  sleep_day %>%
  mutate(ActivityDate = as.Date(SleepDay, format='%m/%d/%Y'))

sleep_day$day_of_week = weekdays(sleep_day$ActivityDate)


sleep_data = merge(sleep_day, cal_daily, by=c('Id', 'ActivityDate', 'day_of_week'))

ggplot(sleep_data, aes(TotalMinutesAsleep, Calories)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

# It seems that their is no significant relation between sleep time and calories burned.

# Average Sleep time in week
avg_sleep = sleep_data %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(avg_sleep_time = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep))

ggplot(avg_sleep) + geom_col(mapping=aes(x=day_of_week, y=avg_sleep_time, fill=day_of_week))

# From the column chart we can see that Average sleep throughout the week is almost same,
# except Sunday , that's probably because Sunday is weekend.

# Average time wasted in bed after sleep
avg_wasted = sleep_data %>%
  mutate(time_wasted = TotalTimeInBed - TotalMinutesAsleep) %>%
  group_by(day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(avg_wasted = mean(time_wasted))

ggplot(avg_wasted) + geom_col(mapping=aes(x=day_of_week, y=avg_wasted, fill=day_of_week))

# From above visualization we can see that most of the users waste more then 50 minutes in bed 
# when it is Sunday. During other weekdays wasted times are between 30-40 minutes


## Weight Log 

ggplot(weight_log) + geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=IsManualReport, fill=IsManualReport))

# We don't have enough data to analyse weight log data deeply, and fat column also contains many 
# NA values . But from our above bar chart we can see that maximum weight log inputs were done 
# manually , which is not a good thing for a business and customer satisfaction.


## Notable  Points

#1 Based on analyzing how Fitbit consumers use and respond to features, recommendations can be
#  made to promote further growth for Bellabeat.

#2 Rather than simply providing data on userâ€™s health, the app should further encourage users
